# data.py
## Overview
The purpose of the 'data.py' file is to store matrices and lists of roles that are used in a larger software project. These matrices and lists represent the relationships and dependencies between different roles in the project. The file provides a convenient way to access and use these data structures within the project.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the 'data.py' file.

## Usage
To use the 'data.py' file in a project, you need to import it and then access the desired data structures. Here is an example:

```python
import data

# Accessing the matrices
msf_matrix = data.msf_matrix
xp_matrix = data.xp_matrix
dsms_matrix = data.dsms_matrix
openup_matrix = data.openup_matrix

# Accessing the lists of roles
msf_roles = data.msf_roles
xp_roles = data.xp_roles
dsms_roles = data.dsms_roles
openup_roles = data.openup_roles

# Using the data structures in your project
# ...
```

## Methods
There are no methods or functions in the 'data.py' file. It only contains the definitions of the matrices and lists of roles.

## Useful details
- The 'msf_matrix' represents the relationship between different roles in the MSF (Microsoft Solutions Framework) methodology. The values in the matrix indicate the strength of the relationship between each pair of roles.

- The 'msf_roles' list contains the names of the roles in the MSF methodology.

- Similarly, the 'xp_matrix' represents the relationship between roles in the Extreme Programming methodology, and the 'xp_roles' list contains the names of the roles.

- The 'dsms_matrix' represents the relationship between roles in the DSMS (Dynamic Systems Development Method) methodology, and the 'dsms_roles' list contains the names of the roles.

- The 'openup_matrix' represents the relationship between roles in the OpenUP (Open Unified Process) methodology, and the 'openup_roles' list contains the names of the roles.

- Each matrix is a 2-dimensional array where the rows and columns correspond to the roles, and the values represent the relationship strengths. The role names in the lists correspond to the indices in the matrices.

- The values in the matrices range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a strong relationship and 0 indicating no relationship.

- These data structures can be used in the larger project to analyze and visualize the relationships between roles, make role assignments, or perform other relevant tasks.
