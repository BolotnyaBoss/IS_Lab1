# data.py
## Overview
The file 'data.py' contains matrices and lists that represent different aspects of a software project. These matrices and lists are used for calculations and decision-making within the project. The file serves as a data source for the project.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific prerequisites to use the file. However, the user should have a basic understanding of matrix operations and Python programming.

## Usage
To use the data in 'data.py', simply import the file into your project. You can then access the matrices and lists as variables.

Example:
```python
import data

msf_matrix = data.msf_matrix
msf_roles = data.msf_roles

# Use the matrices and lists in your project
```

## Methods
There are no methods or functions in the 'data.py' file. It only contains matrices and lists as data variables.

## Useful details
- The 'msf_matrix' represents a matrix of values for different roles in a project. Each row represents a role, and each column represents a factor. The values in the matrix indicate the importance or weight of each factor for each role.

- The 'msf_roles' list contains the names of the roles corresponding to the rows in the 'msf_matrix'.

- Similarly, the 'xp_matrix', 'xp_roles', 'dsms_matrix', 'dsms_roles', 'openup_matrix', and 'openup_roles' variables represent matrices and lists for different aspects of a software project. The names of the roles and factors may vary depending on the specific project context.
