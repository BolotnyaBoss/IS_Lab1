# data.py
## Overview
The 'data.py' file contains several matrices that represent different relationships between roles in a software project. Each matrix represents a specific aspect of the project, such as management, expertise, or collaboration. The role of this file is to provide the data needed for further analysis and decision-making within the project.

## Prerequisites
No dependencies or prerequisites are required to use this file.

## Usage
To use the data provided in this file, simply import it into your project:

```python
import data

# Access the matrices and roles
msf_matrix = data.msf_matrix
msf_roles = data.msf_roles

xp_matrix = data.xp_matrix
xp_roles = data.xp_roles

dsms_matrix = data.dsms_matrix
dsms_roles = data.dsms_roles

openup_matrix = data.openup_matrix
openup_roles = data.openup_roles
```

## Methods
No methods are provided in this file. It only contains data in the form of matrices and role lists.

## Useful details
- The 'msf_matrix' represents the relationship between roles in the context of the Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF). It provides a measure of compatibility or synergy between different roles.
- The 'xp_matrix' represents the relationship between roles in the context of Extreme Programming (XP). It provides a measure of collaboration and interaction between different roles.
- The 'dsms_matrix' represents the relationship between roles in the context of Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM). It provides a measure of collaboration and communication between different roles.
- The 'openup_matrix' represents the relationship between roles in the context of Open Unified Process (OpenUP). It provides a measure of collaboration and interaction between different roles.
- The role lists ('msf_roles', 'xp_roles', 'dsms_roles', 'openup_roles') provide the names of the roles corresponding to each matrix.

Note: The values in the matrices represent the strength of the relationship between roles, with higher values indicating stronger relationships or compatibility.
