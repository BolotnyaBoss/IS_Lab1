# data.py

## Overview
The `data.py` file contains matrices and lists representing different roles and their relationships in a software project. These matrices are used to calculate various metrics and evaluate the performance of individuals in different roles.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `data.py` file.

## Usage
To use the `data.py` file in a project, you simply need to import it and access the matrices and lists defined within it. Here's an example:

```python
import data

print(data.msf_matrix)
print(data.xp_roles)
```

## Methods
There are no methods or functions defined in the `data.py` file. It consists only of matrices and lists.

## Useful details
The `msf_matrix` represents the relationships or weights between different roles in a software project using the MSF (Microsoft Solutions Framework) methodology. The matrix is a 2D list where each row represents a role and each column represents the relationship with another role.

The `msf_roles` list contains the names of the roles corresponding to the rows in the `msf_matrix`.

Similarly, the `xp_matrix` represents the relationships or weights between different roles in a software project using the XP (Extreme Programming) methodology. The `xp_roles` list contains the names of the roles corresponding to the rows in the `xp_matrix`.

The `dsms_matrix` represents the relationships or weights between different roles in a software project using the DSMS (Dynamic Systems Development Method) methodology. The `dsms_roles` list contains the names of the roles corresponding to the rows in the `dsms_matrix`.

The `openup_matrix` represents the relationships or weights between different roles in a software project using the OpenUP (Open Unified Process) methodology. The `openup_roles` list contains the names of the roles corresponding to the rows in the `openup_matrix`.

These matrices and lists can be used to calculate metrics such as role compatibility, team composition, or individual performance evaluation in a software project.
